## Discrete random variable
- A discrete random variable defined as function that maps the sample space to set of real values
- Random variables can take values that are not in the sample space too but they will be mapped to the empty set
- Probability mass function is the probability defined over a given random variable. For a random variable X, p(X = c) is denoted as p(c) and the mapping of each value in a sample space to their respective probability is known as pmf
## Cumulative distribution function
- It is defines as the summed probability upto the given distribution
## Some specific distributions
- Uniform distribution : Starting with the simplest of all distributions, X = Uniform(N) is used to model the scenarios where all the outcomes are equally possible. For example, the probability of getting a heads or tails are equal in case of a fair coin.
- Bernoulli distribution : Bernoulli distribution is used to model the scenarios in which each trail of random experiment has exactly two possible outcomes. One possible outcomes is termed as success and the other as failure.
